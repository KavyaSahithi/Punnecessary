            currently based in Bangalore. I passed out from RVCE in 2017
            and had since then been working full time as an Architect, for a
            reputed firm. A few months ago, I quit my job to pursue higher
            studies abroad but my plans got disrupted due to the pandemic
            situation. To make the most of my free time, I decided to get
            back to my long lost love, of drawing. ‚ù§Ô∏è <br/>
<br/>
            So I started drawing some comics and started an Instagram page
            to make sure I keep up with it üòã and also started drawing some
            portraits for friends and family on the side. Soon, I started
            receiving lots of commissions and orders and so I started doing
            freelance digital illustration full time, and love every minute
            of it!`,
